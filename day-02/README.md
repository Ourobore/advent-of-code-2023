# Day 01 Recap

### What I struggled on
- I wanted to use regexes instead of just using a lot of `split()`. I juste discovered them, and haven't understood everything yet, so I think I could better use them (I finished the parsing with `split()`)

### What I could improve
- I did some `unwrap()`, maybe some of them could use real error management
- Work on regexes

### What I liked about this exercice, what am I proud of
- Using objects in Rust, it was fun to implement them and add them methods
- Using more iterators, especially `filter()` and `fold()` that I discover and force myself to use instead on doing things manually
- My game string parsing :heart:
- My tests: there is a combo of integration and unit tests
