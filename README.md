# advent-of-code-2023

The repository regroups my work on the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/).

My goal for this year version was to do it in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), with two objectives in mind: **discover** and **learn** Rust, and **practice** it.

I'll try to keep up the pace of the challenge, more in the assiduity than aiming for the rankings.

Without further ado, let's go!
