# Day 02 Recap

### What I struggled on
- I really struggled on lifetimes, ownership and borrowing

### What I could improve
- I probably should have use regexes
- I must work on lifetimes, ownership and borrowing
- I commited to much in my `Schematic` struct and I think that's caused some problems in the end
